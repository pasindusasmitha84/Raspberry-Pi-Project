USB Forensic Analyzer - README.txt

Author: Pasindu  
Platform: Linux (Tested on Ubuntu-based systems)  
Dependencies: Python 3.x, fio, dd, tkinter, clamav, entropy/rng modules (custom or external)

Overview:
----------
USB Forensic Analyzer is a GUI-based tool designed to evaluate the integrity, randomness, performance, and security of USB storage devices. It provides forensic-grade metrics for entropy, I/O latency, and virus detection, helping identify anomalies, tampering, or degraded performance.

Usage:
------
Run the GUI:
$ usbscan

Features:
---------

1. WELCOME Tab
   - Displays initial status and scan options.
   - Shows connected USB device path (e.g., /dev/sdb1).
   - Confirms readiness for analysis.

2. Normal Scan
   - Performs a Random Seed Test on the USB device.
   - Metrics:
     • RNG TEST: Verifies pseudo-randomness of sampled data blocks.
     • ENTROPY: Measures unpredictability (max 8.0 bits/byte).
     • RANDOMNESS: Custom deviation score.
     • Result: PASSED/FAILED with summary.
     • "0 new results" means no new anomalies or flagged zones.

3. Random I/O Test
   - Benchmarks random read/write speeds using `fio`.
   - Metrics:
     • Random Read Speed: e.g., 595KiB/s (609kB/s)
     • Random Write Speed: e.g., 607KiB/s (622kB/s)
     • Duration and throughput shown (e.g., 17.4MiB/30029msec)
     • Zone resets: Indicates flash block erasures (0 = clean)

4. Sequential I/O Test
   - Uses `dd` to measure sequential read/write speeds.
   - Metrics:
     • Write Speed: e.g., 45.2 MB/s
     • Read Speed: e.g., 48.7 MB/s
     • File is written and removed after test.
     • Results logged with timestamp.

5. Virus Scan
   - Uses ClamAV to scan the USB device for known malware signatures.
   - Output:
     • Scan summary with infected file count.
     • File paths of detected threats (if any).
     • Timestamped log entry for forensic tracking.

6. Storage Analysis
   - Displays current usage and capacity of the USB device.
   - Metrics:
     • Total Size
     • Used Space
     • Free Space
     • Mount Path
   - Useful for verifying hidden partitions or unexpected usage spikes.

7. Logging
   - All scan results are saved to `performance_log.txt`.
   - Format: ISO timestamp + test type + metrics.
   - Useful for long-term forensic tracking and comparisons.

8. Error Handling
   - If no USB is mounted, appropriate messages are shown.
   - Exceptions are logged for auditability.

Notes:
------
• Ensure `fio`, `dd`, and `clamav` are installed and accessible via CLI.
• Run with appropriate permissions to access /dev/sdX devices.
• For deeper entropy inspection, consider sector-level scans.
